Title: Lab 4: Your Portfolio
Name: Patrick O'Shea poshea
Date: June 5th 2019
Purpose: This is an introductory project to creating websites, using github as a host.
Report: While the websites are overly brief and more than a little ugly, all elements are there: index has a picture and links, bio has a short introduction to who I am, and resume, while a little blank, contains the skeleton of a proper resume.
Time Spent: about 2.5 hours
