This is an introductory project to creating websites, using github as a host.

While the websites are overly brief and more than a little ugly, all elements are there: index has a picture and links, bio has a short introduction to who I am, and resume, while a little blank, contains the skeleton of a proper resume.

I have spent about 2.5 hours working on this lab at this point in time.
