Personal website of Patrick O'Shea

While the resume and the biography pages are sparse on detail, interest, and 
design, they have the advantage of appearing somewhat nice. On the other hand, 
I couldn't quite get the home page to work with flexboxes, so I gave up on the 
container scheme. I also gave up on trying to limit the size of the photo, to a 
more reasonable level when compared to the accompanying line of text, but that 
also failed spectacularly.


Hours Spent: writing was ~2-3, researching was more like 6-7.


Accreditation:
Took advice from Stack Overflow for many parts of the project, the code for most
of which didn't happen to end up in the final design.
