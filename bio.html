		<p>
			I was born in Philadelphia in June of 1995, so I'm now 23 years old. Currently, I am still working on graduating from Tufts University. I have yet to decide the career I want to pursue, though I am mostly interested in software development, as broad as that is. My interests include woodworking, cooking, baking, playing video games, writing.
